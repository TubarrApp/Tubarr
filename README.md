Tubarr is a pre-pre-pre-alpha CLI program (but does function) that can be used to crawl your favorite sites for new videos, download them, then tag them with sister-program Metarr.

Set up a CRON job to run the command as a script for Radarr/Sonarr-esque functionality for Tube sites. Utilizes yt-dlp and browser cookies of your specification to allow downloading even from sites requiring authentication such as censored.tv.
